Welcome to PlanMyDay, <%= @user.first_name %>!
================================================

I'm so glad you're here! As someone with ADHD myself, I built PlanMyDay because I know how overwhelming traditional productivity apps can be.

Here's how to get started:
--------------------------

1. Brain Dump First: Got racing thoughts? Start with the brain dump feature. Just get everything out of your head - no organization needed!

2. Pick 3-5 Tasks: Keep it simple. Your ADHD brain works better with fewer choices.

3. Use the Pomodoro Timer: Work in focused bursts with breaks. It's perfect for ADHD!

4. Celebrate Small Wins: Complete tasks to earn points and unlock sprites. Dopamine hits matter!

Pro Tip: Don't try to do everything at once. Start with just the brain dump today. Tomorrow, try adding a couple of tasks. Build the habit slowly!

Remember, PlanMyDay is actively being improved based on user feedback. If you have suggestions or run into issues, please use the Feedback button in the app - I read every single one!

You've got this!

Best,
The PlanMyDay Team
Built with ðŸ’œ by someone who gets it
