      <h1 style="color: #6B46C1;">Welcome to PlanMyDay, <%= @user.first_name %>! ðŸŽ‰</h1>
      
      <p>I'm so glad you're here! As someone with ADHD myself, I built PlanMyDay because I know how overwhelming traditional productivity apps can be.</p>
      
      <h2 style="color: #6B46C1;">Here's how to get started:</h2>
      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Brain Dump First:</strong> Got racing thoughts? Start with the brain dump feature. Just get everything out of your head - no organization needed!</li>
        <li><strong>Pick 3-5 Tasks:</strong> Keep it simple. Your ADHD brain works better with fewer choices.</li>
        <li><strong>Use the Pomodoro Timer:</strong> Work in focused bursts with breaks. It's perfect for ADHD!</li>
        <li><strong>Celebrate Small Wins:</strong> Complete tasks to earn points and unlock sprites. Dopamine hits matter!</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p style="background-color: #F3F4F6; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #6B46C1;">
        <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Don't try to do everything at once. Start with just the brain dump today. Tomorrow, try adding a couple of tasks. Build the habit slowly!
      </p>
      
      <p>Remember, PlanMyDay is actively being improved based on user feedback. If you have suggestions or run into issues, please use the Feedback button in the app - I read every single one!</p>
      
      <p>You've got this! ðŸ’ª</p>
      
      <p>
        Best,<br>
        The PlanMyDay Team<br>
